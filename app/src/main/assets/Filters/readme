APPStructure:
GLobalData has Editor and input view references and editor has layers and the layers have editable images;


//ImageProcessing files are no longer need functionality moved to others

all shaders here are fragment except vertex that is common for all filter (fragement) shader programs

//all layout(locations) keep same as in uishader

 /////////ERRORS now and possible
//when shader program changes some getting blanck and glUniform1i give invalid opertaion if keeep getting these getUnifromLocation and set glUniform1i or
get location when shader porgramChanges;


/////needs Improve;
keep GLobalData specific to app but AppContext same across all apps.
compiling shaders indicate which shader failed compiling
Graphics.h shaders should not take app as input not just these any wher need app* replace by AppContext::getApp()
