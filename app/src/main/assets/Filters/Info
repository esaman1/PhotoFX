Human eye more sensitive to brighness than color processing images in rgb is result is unreal and unpleasing to eye so RGB TO HSI.

intensity -equal amounts of light.
RGB 6 Saturation. White light is caused by equal amounts of each of R, G and B. If we take the
minimum one of these and subtract that amount from each of R, G and B, then we eliminate the grayscale
(intensity) and what is left has only two color components instead of three (the minimum one is now zero).
Thus this new color has no white light pollution and so it is fully saturated and represents a single wavelength
(see Figure 8.2) or a combination of only two primary colors. It is the saturation. Because I has a maximum
value of 1 here, we can take saturation =1-min(rgb);

//To convert a pixel (H, S, I) in the opposite direction to (R, G, B), we
  consider the cases where the point P isin one of the following regions of the chromaticity triangle: H < 120°
  (red-green), 120° < H < 240° (green-blue), or else 240° < H < 360° (blue-red). The following describe the

IDEAS:normazlized color effect
1.subtracting minimun value of same value from rgb(adding light ,polliutin to the color);
2.when increaing hue only two color values increase and the third one should not.cause hue is (only two colors after subtracting grAY VALUE FROM RGB)
3.saturaction is change by muliplying >and <1 and hue is changed using by inc and dec;
4.processing similar to grayscale can be done on intensity.
5.tranlate,scale,rotate sheer pg(110)(inverse transforms better.)
6.Difference image


Values:
range of eye focal length 14 to 17 mm.
book 1 page 61 image height captured by eyed r
visible spectrum - 0.43um(voilet) to 0.79um(red)
dynamic range - highest/lowest intensity values.
contrast = highest - lowest intensity;

ImageProcessing theroy:
.cones sensitive to color rod give overall picture of field of view and sensitve low levels of illumination(dim light vison).
.in cameras focal length is same but distance beteen image plane and lens is adusted for focusing at various distances whereas in eyes
the distance is fix and  proper focus is acheived varying shape of lens.
.E=hv;light (wave and particle)
.intensity<-> graylevel;
.other than frquency quality of chromatic light is described by radiance,illuminace,brighnes.
.spacial resolution can be line pairs per unit distance,dots per unit distance.
