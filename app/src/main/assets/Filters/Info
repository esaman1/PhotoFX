Human eye more sensitive to brighness than color processing images in rgb is result is unreal and unpleasing to eye so RGB TO HSI.

intensity -equal amounts of light.
RGB 6 Saturation. White light is caused by equal amounts of each of R, G and B. If we take the
minimum one of these and subtract that amount from each of R, G and B, then we eliminate the grayscale
(intensity) and what is left has only two color components instead of three (the minimum one is now zero).
Thus this new color has no white light pollution and so it is fully saturated and represents a single wavelength
(see Figure 8.2) or a combination of only two primary colors. It is the saturation. Because I has a maximum
value of 1 here, we can take saturation =1-min(rgb);

//To convert a pixel (H, S, I) in the opposite direction to (R, G, B), we
  consider the cases where the point P isin one of the following regions of the chromaticity triangle: H < 120°
  (red-green), 120° < H < 240° (green-blue), or else 240° < H < 360° (blue-red).

IDEAS:normazlized color effect(hue or saturation get anim fx)
1.subtracting minimun value of same value from rgb(adding light ,polliutin to the color);
2.when increaing hue only two color values increase and the third one should not.cause hue is (only two colors after subtracting grAY VALUE FROM RGB)
3.saturaction is change by muliplying >and <1 and hue is changed using by inc and dec;
4.processing similar to grayscale can be done on intensity.
5.tranlate,scale,rotate sheer pg(110)(inverse transforms better.)
6.Difference image
7.Shades ,Tones and Tints;
8..MONOCROME SET auu hues to same and check changing sat //Groma gray+monochrome


Values:
range of eye focal length 14 to 17 mm.
book 1 page 61 image height captured by eyed r
visible spectrum - 0.43um(voilet) to 0.79um(red)
dynamic range - highest/lowest intensity values.
contrast = highest - lowest intensity;

ImageProcessing theroy:
.cones sensitive to color rod give overall picture of field of view and sensitve low levels of illumination(dim light vison).
.in cameras focal length is same but distance beteen image plane and lens is adusted for focusing at various distances whereas in eyes
the distance is fix and  proper focus is acheived varying shape of lens.
.E=hv;light (wave and particle)
.intensity<-> graylevel;
.other than frquency quality of chromatic light is described by radiance,illuminace,brighnes.
.spacial resolution can be line pairs per unit distance,dots per unit distance.
  scaling: nearest neighbour,bilinear,bicubic,splines,wavelets etc
  Adjaceny of pixels;
  Distance Measures:
  Fuzzy sets:
  Arithmatice operation between pixel pairs,averagin imagaes for having noise,subrating for dofferemces,diviede/muliply for shading correction.
 Geometric spacial Transforms(110 pg)=spacial transforms(trs sheer(affline tranform) and intensity interpolation.

 CH-3:spacial Processing: intensity transformation(single pixels) and spacial filtering(neighbour hood like sharpening).
 spacial filtering has neighbourhood with predefined operation(determines the filetering process) called spacial filter(spacial mask,kernel,template or window),the
 smallest neighbourhood is 1x1 in which case is intensity(graylevel or mapping) transformation.

 Contrast Streching:getting higher contrast by darkening intesities below k and brightening above k.(pg 129) through thresholding function

 Image Enhancement:is process of manipulating image so that it is better for a specific application.
        Intensity Transformation functs:linear(identity,negative),logarthmic(log ,inverse log),power-law(nth power and root).
          image negative:L-1-r;(l is 256,r is input pix value)(dark regions enhacnce)

          logarhmic:clog(1+r);c-const,r>=0,narrow range of intensity to wider range of intensity values ,expand dark pixel in image while  compressing
          higher level values opposite is true for inverse log.(maybe shadows and highlights) exponential and lgorthmic are inverese funcion mirror about y=x;
          (spreadin adn compressiong of intensity values) log function compress dynamic range of image with large variation of pixel values while for non large
          variation power law may be considered.(lower intensities increase much while higher remains almost same_

          Powelaw  transformations:(gamma correction ,contrast manipulation)
          s=crpowerg where c and g are positive constants
